# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this project is to devolope a webpage to assist students going through the coding bootcamp with studying for the Prework moduels while learning about how to code. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This serves to remind students of important information to review as well as giving a physical example of exactly what the results looks like firsthand as well as how to interact with the code.

## Usage

There are two ways to use the site: you can either read from top to bottom to get the information in the order the topics were covered or you can open ChromeDevTools (Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows)) and find a suggestion for a random subject to study and review your notes. 

An example of using ChromeDevTools is included below
